My name is Miguel GÃ³mez and I am a data analyst based in Germany. I hold a MSc in Big Data & Analytics and I am into data analysis, programming and visualization, which I do mostly in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).  

Feel free to check the [projects](https://miguel-gomez.github.io/projects/) I am working on or have a look at my [blog](https://miguel-gomez.github.io/blog/). Due to my background in social sciences, related topics will pop up there, but always from a data science perspective.  

If you are interested in any of the above, it will be a pleasure to [talk](mailto:miguel.gomez.contact@gmail.com) about it!
